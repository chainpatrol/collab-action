# ChainPatrol

### About this app

The [ChainPatrol](https://chainpatrol.com/) mini-app gives your community members
access to security tools to check URLs for scams and report malicious activity
on your Discord server. Use the `/chainpatrol <sub-command>` commands to empower
your community to protect themselves from phishing attacks and other scams.

### Getting Started

To get started, install the ChainPatrol mini-app from the
[Collab.Land Marketplace](https://cc.collab.land/).

Your community members can then use `/chainpatrol check` to check suspect URLs
against the global scam list if they see any suspicious messages.

They can also report scams to ChainPatrol using the `/chainpatrol report`
command and we'll investigate the report. If we find the report to be credible,
we'll add the URL to our global scam list that is used by wallets like Coinbase
and MetaMask to protect all of Web3. Help us protect the whole Web3 community by
reporting scams to wallets!

### Configuration (optional)

Without configuration, reports will be sent to the ChainPatrol team for review.

If you would like to be able to review reports and keep note of which community
members are helping protect your server, you can
[reach out to the ChainPatrol team](https://chainpatrol.io/onboard/collab-land)
to get a custom admin dashboard associated to your server.
