# ChainPatrol

### About this app

The [ChainPatrol](https://chainpatrol.io/) mini-app gives your community members
access to security tools to check URLs for scams and report malicious activity
on your Discord server. Use the `/chainpatrol <sub-command>` commands to empower
your community to protect themselves from phishing attacks and other scams.

### Getting Started

To get started, install the ChainPatrol mini-app from the
[Collab.Land Marketplace](https://cc.collab.land/).

Your community members can then start using `/chainpatrol check` to start
checking URLs whenever they are unsure of a message that has been sent in your
Discord server. If they find a scam, they can use the `/chainpatrol report`
command to report the scam to ChainPatrol.

### Configuration

Without configuration, reports will be sent to the ChainPatrol team for review.
If you would like to be able to review reports and keep note of which community
members are helping protect your server, you can reach out to the ChainPatrol
team to get a custom admin dashboard associated to your server.
